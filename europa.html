    <p style="text-align: left; margin-right: 50%; ">Slightly smaller than Earth's Moon, Europa is primarily made of
        silicate rock and has a water-ice crust and probably an
        iron–nickel core. It has a very thin atmosphere, composed primarily of oxygen. Its surface is striated by cracks
        and
        streaks, but craters are relatively few.</p>

    <p style="text-align: left; margin-right: 50%; width: 659px; ">Shallow lakes-The presence of shallow lakes also
        means that surface waters are probably vigorously mixing with deeper water.<br>The icy eddies could transfer
        nutrients between the surface water and the ocean's depths."That could make
        Europa and its ocean more habitable," said lead author Britney Schmidt from the University of Texas at Austin,
        US, who
        analysed images collect by the Galileo spacecraft launched in 1989.<br>
        Glaciologists have been studying the surface of Europa for many years, trying to work out what formed its
        scarred,
        fractured surface.By looking at Antarctica, where we see similar things.</p>
