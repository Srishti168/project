      <p>The smallest of the four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter,Europa is a winter lover’s dream.
       With an icy surface, it’s perfect for a bit of ice skating, curling, hockey, or simple relaxation in your snug wintery cabin.<br>
      The average distance from earth would be around <i>628 million km </i>and the estimated time for our flight would be <i> 3 years</i> .

       <u>Spacecraft:</u><br>
        Europa Clipper is a Jupiter-orbiting spacecraft carrying science instruments to study Jupiter’s icy moon Europa. With a 
        sophisticated suite of scientific instruments, Europa Clipper will be the most advanced spacecraft ever sent to investigate
        the habitability of another world.<br>A metal box known as a radiation vault will shield Europa Clipper’s electronics from 
        Jupiter’s harsh radiation. The vault’s walls are an alluminum alloy about 0.3 inches (9.2 millimeters) thick.<br><br>

        <u>Cost:</u><br>

  
       The cost of the clipper mission was estimated in 2012 at just under $2 billion, while the cost of a landing on 
        Europa was pegged at $2.8 billion.<br>
